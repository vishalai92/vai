title: "Setting up your number"
---

We're going to start by getting a number that we can use for our receptionist. There are two ways to get numbers compatible
with Vocode:

1. Linking your own telephony provider via [BYO Telephony](/bring-your-own-telephony).
2. Purchasing a number directly via Vocode telephony.

If you're on the Free plan, you'll have to upgrade your account in order to either purchase numbers via Vocode telephony or
to link your own Twilio account via [BYO Telephony](/bring-your-own-telephony).

# Linking your own Twilio numbers

You can link your own telephony account once you've upgraded your plan by following the
documentation in [BYO Telephony](/bring-your-own-telephony). We'll quickly walk through the steps here for adding your own
Twilio account.

First, we're going to link our Twilio account via [Account Connections](/account-connections).

```python
account_connection = vocode_client.account_connections.create_account_connection(
    request={
        "type": "account_connection_twilio",
        "credentials": {
            "twilio_account_sid": os.getenv("TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID"),
            "twilio_auth_token": os.getenv("TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"),
        },
    }
)
```

Now, once we have a phone number from our Twilio account, we can link it to Vocode using the link number functionality.

```python
number_to_link = "1123456789"
print(
    vocode_client.numbers.link_number(
        phone_number=number_to_link,
        telephony_account_connection=account_connection_id,
    )
)
```

# Buying a number

You can use the `numbers/buy` endpoint to purchase numbers via Vocode telephony or via your own account connection. Here,
we purchase one using Vocode telephony.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
phone_number = vocode_client.numbers.buy_number(BuyPhoneNumberRequest(area_code="415", telephony_provider="twilio"))
```

```typescript TypeScript
const phoneNumber = await vocode.numbers.buyNumber();
```

</CodeGroup>

You can specify which telephony provider you want to use, the current supported options are: `twilio` and `vonage`.

You'll get a response that looks like:

```json
{
  "id": "***",
  "user_id": "***",
  "number": "11234567890",
  "inbound_agent": {...},
  "telephony_provider": "twilio",
  "telephony_account_connection": null,
  ...
}
```

Your phone number is now active! Let's start configuring the number to work as our receptionist.
