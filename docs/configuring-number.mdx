Now that we have a number set up on Vocode, our agent is ready to start accepting calls. Vocode [Agents](/agents)
have several different parameters we can use to control its behavior. We're going to be setting up our receptionist
by modifying:

1. Voice -> this is the voice of our agent
2. Prompt -> the prompt is the instruction we give our agent that controls its behavior
3. Actions -> actions are things that the agent **_can do_** like end the conversation or
   make an API request to an external service (like a calendar booking software)

## Setting up our receptionist

### Voice

First, let's create a new voice via [ElevenLabs]("https://elevenlabs.io) and grab the voice ID.

```
voice = vocode_client.voices.create_voice(
    request={
        "type": "voice_eleven_labs",
        "voice_id": "06oPEcZqPWhZ2IeTcOJc",
        "stability": ".2",
        "similarity_boost": ".75",
        "model_id": "eleven_turbo_v2",
        "optimize_streaming_latency": "4",
    }
)

voice_id = voice.id
```

For other voice options curated by Vocode, check out our page on [Voices](/voices). Voice clones are also available on demand
for enterprise accounts.

### Prompt

The prompt is how our agent will know what instructions to follow on the call. We're going to set up a prompt suitable for a
receptionist agent and create a prompt object in the API:

```
PROMPT = """
sample prompt
"""

prompt = vocode_client.prompts.create_prompt(request={"content": PROMPT})
prompt_id = prompt.id
```

For more guidance on how prompts work check out our guide on [Prompt Objects](/prompts) and [Prompt Engineering](/prompt-engineering).

### Actions

Finally, for our receptionist to be complete, we're going to want to give it the ability to actually do two things:

1. End the conversation
2. Make an API call to our calendar software to book calendar appointments.

Let's set up both of these actions using the API:

```python

# This action ends the conversation
end_conversation_action = vocode_client.actions.create_action(
    request=ActionParamsRequest(type="action_end_conversation", config={})
)

# This action makes an API call to our calendar endpoint
calendar_action = vocode_client.actions.create_action(
    request={
        "type": "action_external",
        "config": {
            "name": "Meeting_Booking_Assistant",
            "description": ("Book a meeting for a 30 minute or 1 hour call."),
            "url": "http://example.com/booking",
            "speak_on_send": True,
            "speak_on_receive": True,
            "input_schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "length": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["30m", "1hr"],
                    },
                    "time": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "pattern": "^\d{2}:\d0[ap]m$",
                    },
                },
            },
        },
    },
)
```

For more information on how to set up actions, check out our [Actions](/actions) guide and our new beta feature
[External Actions](/external-actions) which we are using here to make the calendar API call.

## Updating our agent

Now that we've created our voice, prompt, and actions, we can run a query to update our agent as follows. We'll
also add an `initial_message` to our agent to greet people who call in.

We'll have to first grab the `agent_id` in order to make the `agent/update` request. Here's how we can grab it from our
phone number:

```python
number = vocode_client.numbers.get(phone_number="1123456789")
agent_id = number.agent_id
print(agent_id)
```

Which should output a UUID for our agent.

```
ad1d802e-12ab-41c7-8726-14e119d6c92c
```

And now we can use the `agent_id` in our update request as follows:

```python
INITIAL_MESSAGE = "Hi, this is a Vocode scheduling agent, how can I help you?"

update_response = vocode_client.agents.update_agent(
    id=agent_id,
    request=AgentUpdateParams(
        initial_message=INITIAL_MESSAGE,
        prompt=prompt_id,
        voice=voice_id,
        actions=[end_conversation_action_id, external_action_id],
    ),
)
```

Now our agent is ready to be a receptionist! Check it out by giving it a call.
