title: "Setting up a webhook"
---

Now that we have our receptionist Agent configured, we want to set up an automation so that every time we
receive a call, we can process the results once the call has ended.

## Setting up our webhook

We'll use the [Webhooks](/webhooks) feature on the Agent to configure our automations. First, let's create a
webhook that posts to `"https://example.com"` every time a call ends.

```python Python
from vocode import AgentUpdateParams, EventType, HttpMethod, WebhookUpdateParams

new_webhook = WebhookUpdateParams(
    subscriptions=[EventType.EVENT_PHONE_CALL_ENDED],
    url="https://example.com",
    method=HttpMethod.POST,
)
```

Now, we can add this to our Agent by using the `agent/update` endpoint like before:

```python Python
update_response = vocode_client.agents.update_agent(
    id=agent_id,
    request=AgentUpdateParams(
        webhook=new_webhook.id
    ),
)
```

## Sample webhook server

In order to process the result of our webhook, we can set up a simple endpoint to receive
webhook messages from Vocode. [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site) makes it very easy to set up
a sample endpoint.
