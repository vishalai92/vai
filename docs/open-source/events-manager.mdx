## What is the Events Manager

The Events Manager consumes realtime events during conversations - it provides a framework to consume and take action on these events asychronously.

## Current Event Types

The current event types include:

1. `TRANSCRIPT`: Indicates a partial transcript for the conversation has been received.
2. `TRANSCRIPT_COMPLETE`: Indicates the transcript is complete (ie conversation has ended).
3. `ACTION`: Indicates that a Vocode action has begun or completed.
4. `PHONE_CALL_CONNECTED`: Indicates a phone call has been connected (only gets sent during `PhoneConversation`s)
5. `PHONE_CALL_ENDED`: Indicates a phone call has ended.

## Usage

Using the events manager to take particular action when events fire requires that you subclass `vocode.streaming.utils.EventsManager` and override the `handle_event` method.

You can also configure which events your `EventsManager` is subscribed to by using the `subscriptions` property (see example).

### Example

```python
from vocode.streaming.models.events import Event, EventType

from vocode.streaming.models.events import Event, EventType
from vocode.streaming.models.transcript import TranscriptCompleteEvent
from vocode.streaming.utils.events_manager import EventsManager


class CustomEventsManager(EventsManager):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__([EventType.TRANSCRIPT_COMPLETE])

    async def handle_event(self, event: Event):
        if isinstance(event, TranscriptCompleteEvent):
            print("The call has finished, the transcript was", event.transcript.to_string())
```

In this example, we create a custom `EventsManager` subclass is created with a subscription to the `TRANSCRIPT_COMPLETE` event and then print the transcript when we receive the event.

To use `CustomEventsManager`, you can pass it into any Conversation, e.g.

```
...
conversation = StreamingConversation(
    ...,
    events_manager=CustomEventsManager()
)
```

You can also pass it into a `TelephonyServer`, like:

```
server = TelephonyServer(
    ...,
    events_manager=CustomEventsManager()
)
```
