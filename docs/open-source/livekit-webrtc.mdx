# Overview

[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) is an alternative to websockets for real-time P2P communication. Vocode Agents are compatible with both WebRTC and websockets, enabling developers to pick
the stack best suited for their application.

To connect Vocode agents to WebRTC, Vocode uses [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/)–an open source platform for building on WebRTC. For a background on how LiveKit
works, please see their [documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/get-started/intro-to-livekit/).

In this guide, we'll be walking through how to connect a Vocode Agent to the [LiveKit Agents Playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io/).

# Walkthrough: hooking up a Vocode Agent to a LiveKit Room

## Setting up your LiveKit Server

First, you'll want to set up a LiveKit Server for your Agent. For simplicity, we are using LiveKit's hosted offering–but it can also be self hosted, since LiveKit is open source!

In our LiveKit dashboard, we first generate our websocket URL, API key, and Secret Key.

## Deploying your Vocode agent to a LiveKit Room

Once you have your LiveKit Server credentials, we can hook it up to Vocode via the `LiveKitConversation` abstraction. Using the starter code in
[vocode-core/apps/livekit/app.py](https://github.com/vocodedev/vocode-core/blob/main/apps/livekit/app.py), you can quickly deploy a Vocode Agent to accept
new job requests.

Fill in your credentials in `.env`:

```bash

LIVEKIT_SERVER_URL=wss://your-livekit-ws-url.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY="KEY"
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET="SECRET"
```

Followed by
`poetry run python app.py dev`

And now you can connect to the [Agents Playground](https://agents-playground.livekit.io/) to interact with your agent. With LiveKit, you can connect Vocode
agents to any web application and leverage their [React Component](https://docs.livekit.io/reference/components/react/) library.
