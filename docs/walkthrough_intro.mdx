Welcome to the Vocode API! We've got a lot of powerful features that we're going to illustrate
by setting up a receptionist agent that can take calls and book calendar appointments.

We'll cover how to do it step-by-step entirely via API or you could also follow along usig our
[Dashboard]("https://dashboard.vocode.dev).

In particular, we'll go through the following steps:

1. Setting up a phone number
2. Configuring the number with an inbound agent
3. Modifying the agent prompt, voice, and actions
4. Setting up a webhook to listen to call updates
5. Retrieving call data via API

Let's start with setting up our phone number.
