# Phrase Triggers

Phrase triggers allow users to more explicitly control the behavior of their agents by configuring actions to run only once a bot has spoken a particular phrase. For example, you can configure an agent to transfer a call to a human agent only after the bot has said "I will transfer now".

## Creating a phrase trigger

You can create a phrase trigger as follows:

```python
from vocode import (
    PhraseBasedActionTrigger,
    PhraseBasedActionTriggerConfig,
    PhraseTrigger,
)

phrase_trigger = PhraseBasedActionTrigger(
    config=PhraseBasedActionTriggerConfig(
        phrase_triggers=[
            PhraseTrigger(
                phrase="I will transfer now",
                conditions=["phrase_condition_type_contains"],
            ),
            PhraseTrigger(
                phrase="You can speak to a human now",
                conditions=["phrase_condition_type_contains"],
            )
        ]
    )
)
```

In this example, the action that this phrase trigger is attached to will fire only after the bot has spoken a turn that contains "I will transfer now" or "You can speak to a human now".

`"phrase_condition_type_contains"` is the only condition type supported at this time, and does not match case, so in the above example, if the bot said "Okay, you can speak to a human now", the phrase trigger would still fire.

## Configuring your action

```python
from vocode import (
    TransferCallActionParams,
    TransferCallConfig,
)

vocode_client.agents.update_agent(
    actions=[
        TransferCallActionParams(
            type="action_transfer_call",
            config=TransferCallConfig(
                transfer_phone_number="<YOUR TRANSFER PHONE NUMBER>",
            ),
            action_trigger=phrase_trigger # from the previous code block
        )
    ]
)
```

# [Default] Function Call Triggers

To switch back to the default behavior, use a `FunctionCallActionTrigger`. These are open ended, meaning the
Agent will decide when to use the action based on its prompting. Note that is is primarily achieved via the [Prompt](/prompts)
but for [External Actions](/external-actions), it is also dependent on the description field.

```python
from vocode import FunctionCallActionTrigger

function_trigger = FunctionCallActionTrigger(config={})
vocode_client.agents.update_agent(
    actions=[
        TransferCallActionParams(
            type="action_transfer_call",
            config=TransferCallConfig(
                transfer_phone_number="<YOUR TRANSFER PHONE NUMBER>",
            ),
            action_trigger=function_trigger
        )
    ]
)
```
